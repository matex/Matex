Hello and welcome to the Matex project. Matex aims to add functionality to latex,
such as math calculations. It works by using Mathomatic, llpp (Will later work
for most pdfviewers), and the latex suite. It exacts the data from a latex file
.tex and passes the extracted data through mathomatic, returns the answer and
converts that back to the latex format and append the string with the result.

Matex aims also add gnuplot plot graphs, to have mathematical functionality to
compute results without ever leaving the latex suite.
